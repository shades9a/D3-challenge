# D3-challenge
This was ver dificult and very tedius. Making the bubbles work was a head ache.
Making them slide around took much longer than needed.
Some guides that I followed were very complex and had some sleepless nights finding some missing citations.
Most guides I found seems to work best if I had made extra work.
This made it a nightmare, I hope to not do more later.
